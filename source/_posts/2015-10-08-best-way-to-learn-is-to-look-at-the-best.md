Most people I&#8217;ve worked with don&#8217;t like to learn in an ordered manner from a textbook. They enjoy experimentation more than anything, because it allows them to see how things are moving when change is applied.

And because I&#8217;ve been working with [React][1] lately, I thought it would be a good idea to see an isomorphic application at its best, so I started to dig Facebook&#8217;s desktop implementation.

After overcoming the disappointment that they didn&#8217;t implement it [universally][2], I did discover some gems in their frontend code.

To be continued.
