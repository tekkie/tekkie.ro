After many years of dominance from Microsoft&#8217;s [Internet Explorer][1], after [Mozilla Firefox][2] becaming our second nature, with interesting interface solutions from Safari, Google decides to enter the battle with the all-[new Chrome][3]. It&#8217;s not easy this time, but I think the tekkie world will quickly adopt it. It easily passes the [ACID2][4] test and gets 78 out of 100 for [ACID3][5]. So for us developers it looks like they are on the [right path][6], learning from others&#8217; mistakes.

Like Firefox [managed to eat slowly][7] from IE&#8217;s slice for some time now by doing right the things that were frustrating and annoying users, Google is determined to fight using the same tactics.

  * So, people use Mozilla because it has many plugins? Yes, but it eats up your memory, so Chrome has a new approach isolating each tab as a separate process and giving you freedom of navigation.
  * Developers love the Firebug extension and can&#8217;t imagine working without it? Chrome gives us &#8220;inspect element&#8221; option in the contextual page menu.
  * Browsers timidly tried to suggest things while you were typing in the address bar? Chrome is all too Google-ish in this respect&#8230; just try it!
  * People are afraid of using yet-another-application for browsing the web because they use keyboard shortcuts? Just try the regular CTRL + F, CTRL + H or CTRL + J. Ah, and of course your Mozilla saved passwords, bookmarks and other stuff is offered to you during install. Can it get any better?

All the things which frustrated the guys are now attempting to get solved. They&#8217;re at least trying. Of course it&#8217;s beta and there are no things like mouse gestures yet, but the Google approach is different; they build early, launch soon. They offer the solutionto some problems and continue building upon it, and that&#8217;s what really makes the difference.

If you like watching all the features and architectural decisions in a non-conventional way, try the [comic book][8]. These guys just don&#8217;t market the usual way.
