In order to work remotely with the GitHub repositories you need to verify your SSH keys, because of the vulnerability described in [their blog post][1].

To approve your SSH key, please login on GitHub.com and then navigate to  
[ https://gi​thub.com/s​ettings/ss​h/audit][2]  
and approve each key individually.
