A group of computer science majors were listening to a lecture about Java programming at a university.  
After the lecture one of the men leaned over and grabbed a woman&#8217;s breast.

Woman: &#8211; Hey! Thats private, OK!?

The man hesitated for a second looking confused.

Man: &#8211; But I thought we were in the same class.
