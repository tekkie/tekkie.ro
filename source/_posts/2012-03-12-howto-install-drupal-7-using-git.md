So you decided to give it a try and are tired of downloading an archive, unpacking, blah-blah?

Just

  1. navigate to your web server document root folder
  2. create yourself a working directory, like `mkdir vanilla_drupal`
  3. and use the clone command `git clone --branch 7.x git://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git ./`

You can now move directly to the &#8220;Create configuration file&#8230;&#8221; section of the [quick installer page][1].
