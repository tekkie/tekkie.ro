Every project, be it small, medium or large, needs tracking down its status and pieces of work / research. A team of people will bring the project to completion, so even if the team has only one member, a way of tracking down its status and work left is extremely important for having always a quick and accurate overview.

For managing small projects, I have found a nice <a href="http://nokahuna.com/" alt="Website of No Kahuna">collaborative task tracker</a> with minimal features. It allows for setting up projects, creating tasks, distributing them and tracking them down for completion.
