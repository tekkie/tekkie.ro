We all have to make a presentation sooner or later. But it&#8217;s not easy, and there are a lot of hints, advices or tips & tricks to help you in this process. But all assume you&#8217;re using something similar to Powerpoint. They all teach you how to create and present the content, very few show you how to present it in a way for the others to remember. That&#8217;s why I recommend you try [Prezi.com][1], to make your presentation unique. If you don&#8217;t believe me, [take a quick look][2].
