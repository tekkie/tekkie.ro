Don&#8217;t show a [picture of one product][1] and the [name of another][2]. It&#8217;s just so&#8230;

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-241" title="HTC_HeroOrSprint" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.tekkie.ro/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/HTC_HeroOrSprint.png?fit=331%2C622" alt="HTC_HeroOrSprint" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I know they&#8217;re both called Hero. But one&#8217;s also a Sprint.

Do your research before stuffing items in Photoshop and deliver your project. And do have a second pair of eyes around you before you push this live.
