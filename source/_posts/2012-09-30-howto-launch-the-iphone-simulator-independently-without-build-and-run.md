Sometimes you don&#8217;t need to start Xcode, so it&#8217;s useful to start it independently.

  * right-click the Finder in the Dock
  * <pre>choose "Go to Folder..."</pre>

  * <pre>use the follosing path: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/D‌​eveloper/Applications/</pre>

  * <pre>launch the iPhone Simulator.app you find there</pre>
