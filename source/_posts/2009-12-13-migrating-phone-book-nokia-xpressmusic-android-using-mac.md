Looks complicated, huh? Especially when people say there&#8217;s no real Mac-to-Android sync software.

But we&#8217;re all tekkies here, we solve stuff, and don&#8217;t complain about it ðŸ˜‰ And we&#8217;re using free software to do it, yummy!

All you need is [PhoneDirector][1] to get your Nokia agenda on the Mac. Just install it and follow the instructions, you should be just fine. After you get all this, export them into a .vcf file, we&#8217;ll need it in a moment.

Now, to get this info in the Android is really a piece of cake. Go to the Contacts settings in Gmail and import the .vcf file you generated with PhoneDirector. Then go to your Android phone and sync your contacts. Ta-da! Welcome to the Google world!

NB: if you&#8217;re having a hard time finding the Contacts in the Gmail app, like I did, look immediately under your labels list.

The above steps weren&#8217;t good for you? Then you might need to take a look at [this][2].
