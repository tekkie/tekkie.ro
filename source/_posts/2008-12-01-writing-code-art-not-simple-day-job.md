Think about how you develop your own code.

Do you rush into writing a piece of code and use comments later, if you have any time left? Or do you use a pseudocode approach by writing comments n the first place and then developing functionality to implement that?

Do you develop code in such a way that it can be later tested and mainained? Or do you write it, prove &#8220;it works&#8221; and think about it next time you have to adjust functionality?

Do you favor speed for maintainability?

These are the lessons one learns while reading [Code Complete][1], a book which aims to learn you how to do stuff **right**, not &#8220;just do it&#8221;. I like it more and more while I&#8217;m reading it. Most of the examples present common-sense development, yet I&#8217;ve seen so much poor code which does the job that I would like to reccommend it to all software developers. If you do read it, I can only promise it&#8217;ll make you a better colleague than you already might be.
