<span><strong>C</strong></span>** **would be <span><strong>Judaism</strong></span> &#8211; it&#8217;s old and restrictive, but most of the world is familiar with its laws and respects them. The catch is, you can&#8217;t convert into it &#8211; you&#8217;re either into it from the start, or you will think that it&#8217;s insanity. Also, when things go wrong, many people are willing to blame the problems of the world on it.

<span class="fullpost"><span><strong>Java</strong></span><strong> </strong>would be <span><strong>Fundamentalist Christianity</strong></span> &#8211; it&#8217;s theoretically based on C, but it voids so many of the old laws that it doesn&#8217;t feel like the original at all. Instead, it adds its own set of rigid rules, which its followers believe to be far superior to the original. Not only are they certain that it&#8217;s the best language in the world, but they&#8217;re willing to burn those who disagree at the stake.</p>

<p>
  <strong>PHP</strong> would be <strong>Cafeteria Christianity</strong> &#8211; Fights with Java for the web market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really likes. Maybe it&#8217;s not as coherent as other languages, but at least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core idea of the whole thing. Also, the whole concept of &#8220;goto hell&#8221; was abandoned.
