I like [this guy][1], I&#8217;ve never seen him before (even though he&#8217;s a member of the GoF), he has a funny accent and uses it to tell us [how Eclipse development has evolved][2] over the years. As many of us use [Eclipse][3] as a base of our development (or derivates, like [Aptana][4]), I think it might be interesting for you to take a look at this and their retrospective helps us focus on the right things.

It&#8217;s always a good way of learning and improving yourself by looking at how others do it, take and adapt those things that make it better for you. I particularly liked the phrase &#8220;more democratic than scrum&#8221;, I wouldn&#8217;t have imagined such a thing is possible.

Ah, and let&#8217;s not forget the &#8220;let me fix it by commenting the assertion, this will make our build green&#8221;.
