So, you want to use that Apple machine for developing websites. That&#8217;s pretty easy to setup, here are some guidelines you can use in order to create the basic environment for creating great web applications.

  1. **MAMP ** 
      * even though you already have Apache and PHP installed (oh, and Ruby as well), you also need the mySQL; basically it&#8217;s not that trivial to add the popular DB to the mix, and this is where MAMP comes into play: it provides the sqlite for quick and easy part, and also mySQL for the more complicated items
      * it also includes the phpMyAdmin in case you don&#8217;t want to use  more powerful tool
      * download it from [the official page][1] or [from sourceforge][2]
      * installation is pretty straightforward, but do take a look at [the last section here][3]
      * start the MAMP application
      * the path to your webroot is `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs`
  2. **Editor** 
      1. [Aptana][4] is for heavy users 
          * since it&#8217;s based on Eclipse, you&#8217;ll quickly find your way around
          * [download][5] it from here and use the [online documentation][6] in case you run into trouble
      2. Smultron is a light-weight, extremely capable and configurable editor 
          * please don&#8217;t get fooled by the looks of it, take your time and explore it; it&#8217;s a valuable companion
          * the [SourceForge page][7] of the Smultron project
          * get directly the [improved interface][8], a patch which appeared on the internet because many users complained about the icons
  3. a developer&#8217;s **file manager**: [muCommander][9] 
      * usually you&#8217;ll find yourself limited by the multitude of Finder windows, so you&#8217;ll miss the MidnightCommander / TotalCommander / etc. software; meet muCommander; since it runs on amy platform, you might just take it with you on your other environments and modernize the old `mc`
      * [here][10]&#8216;s an alternative download source

That should be it. Congratulations!
