First bugs have appeared in Chrome. Ok, it&#8217;s still a beta release, but you should be aware that:

  * it doesn&#8217;t love youtube videos
  * suddenly and unexpectedly crashes with no particular reason, after normal browsing
  * it is unable to render XML files properly

[singlepic id="1" w="320" h="240" mode="" float="" ]

  * doesn&#8217;t remember the last session tabs

<div>
  &#8230; will be continued.
