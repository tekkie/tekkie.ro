Oftentimes I have been called a web developer, because I entered the software world from PHP. I had another burden as well: as a girl, I was taken less seriously than my colleagues, having to work much harder. But I liked what I was doing, and I wanted to do it better, smarter, more efficient. Many colleagues have helped me become better, and showed me a lot of helpful tricks. I learned first-hand about the hurdles which make a software developer&#8217;s journey to craftsmanship tedious, and about the strength and perseverance needed to continue. Although there are many paths that can be followed to producing high-quality, easy to maintain software, none of them can actually be viewed as standard.

Some people, myself included, are better learning things following a structured approach, like a book, and I tried hard to find one that would be less about the tricks of the trade and more about the various aspects of what is means to be a software developer, and what that role means in the greater scheme of things.

As today&#8217;s world calls for more programmers than are available, it is my intention to summarize the steps I have followed successfully, parts of which I have advertised to colleagues we have onboarded, and which I believe can be inspiring others searching for their way.

Everyone can enter the development world, and it&#8217;s great to work in a profession so rewarding. Most people get hooked very soon, and want to continue, but find it difficult to pick their next step. They need help, and I believe structuring the dissipated available information will help them tremendously.

In the past, I found it easy to present things using a pyramid model, so today I am simply introducing it, and a more detailed explanation of each stage will follow separately, to allow for a better understanding of it.
